## 5. Applications in Therapy

**Specific Use Cases:**
- **Occupational Therapy**: Exercises for fine motor control through precise gesture movements
- **Art Therapy**: Expressive arts therapy applications with remote therapist guidance
- **Rehabilitation**: Gradual motor skill rebuilding for patients recovering from injury
- **Cognitive Training**: Creative exercises that encourage focus and executive function
- **Social Skills Development**: Collaborative drawing sessions for social interaction practice

**Example Implementation:**
"A rehabilitation center implemented DrawWave in their occupational therapy program for patients recovering from stroke. The natural gesture interface allowed patients to engage in drawing exercises that promoted fine motor control, while the collaboration feature enabled therapists to guide patients remotely. After 8 weeks, patients showed a 32% improvement in fine motor precision compared to traditional methods."

## 8. Live Demonstration

**Demo Outline:**
1. Creating a new drawing session
2. Demonstrating the three core hand gestures:
   - Drawing mode (index finger extended)
   - Eraser mode (index and middle fingers extended)
   - Idle mode (all fingers extended)
3. Inviting a collaborator to join the session
4. Showing real-time synchronization between users
5. Demonstrating session persistence by refreshing the browser
6. Showcasing final collaborative artwork

**Demo Script:**
"Let me show you DrawWave in action. I'll start by creating a new session and demonstrating the intuitive gesture controls. Notice how I can draw by simply extending my index finger, erase by extending two fingers, and stop drawing by showing all five fingers. Now, let's invite a collaborator to join our session..."
